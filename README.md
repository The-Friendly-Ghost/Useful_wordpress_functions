WordPress is a powerful CMS. It has thousands of useful free and paid plugins that you can use. However, every now and then I encounter a certain problem that cannot seem to be fixed by any plugin. Another thing that regularly happens is that I do not want to download an entire plugin to solve one little problem.

Over the years I build up a small collection of functions that helped me solve some problems. In this repository you can find this collection.

Important: I did not create the functions in this repository myself. Most of the functions are from Stackoverflow, Github, YouTube tutorials or other places. I just edited the functions to fit my needs and added comments to make the functions better understandable for people without a lot of programming knowledge.
